# üß† Physics-Informed Neural Network for 2D Heat Equation

This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the **2D transient heat diffusion equation** over a unit square domain using only the governing **partial differential equation (PDE)** and **boundary/initial conditions**, without any labeled solution data.

PINNs leverage the underlying physics (in the form of differential equations) by incorporating the residual of the PDE directly into the loss function. This method allows solving complex physics problems using deep learning without requiring ground-truth simulation data.

## üìê Governing Equation

The 2D heat equation is:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( u(x, y, t) \) is the temperature field
- \( \alpha \) is the thermal diffusivity (here set to 0.01)

## üß™ Physics Constraints

- **Initial condition**:
  \[
  u(x, y, 0) = \sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y)
  \]
- **Boundary condition**:
  \[
  u(x=0,1, y, t) = u(x, y=0,1, t) = 0
  \]
